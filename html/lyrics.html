    You were the shadow to my light
    Did you feel us?
    Another start
    You fade away
    Afraid our aim is out of sight
    Wanna see it alight
    Where are you now?
    Where are you now?
    Was it all in my fantasy?
    Were you only imaginary?
    Atlantis
    Under the sea
    Under the sea
    Another dream
    The monsters running wild inside of me
    I′m faded
    So lost
    I'm faded
    These shallow waters never met
    What I needed
    I′m letting go
    A deeper dive
    Eternal silence of the sea
    I'm breathing
    Alive
    Under the bright but faded lights
    You set my heart on fire
    Where are you now?
    Where are you now?
    I'm faded
    I′m faded
    You were the shadow to my light
    Did you feel us?
    Another start
    You fade away
    Afraid our aim was out of sight
    Wanna see it alight
    Where are you now?
    Was it all in my fantasy?
    Were you only imaginary?
    Was it all in my fantasy?
    Were you only imaginary?
    You were the shadow to my light
    Did you feel us?
    Another start
    You fade away
    Afraid our aim was out of sight
    Wanna see it alight
    Where are you now?
    Atlantis under the sea
    Under the sea
    Another dream
    The monsters running wild inside of me
    I′m faded
    I'm faded
    I′m faded
    The monsters running wild inside of me
    I'm faded
